# 👋 Hi, I’m Krisha Mansukhani  
### Biostatistics • Data Science • Health Analytics  

🎓 **M.S. Biological Data Science** — *Arizona State University, 2025*  
🧮 **Biostatistics Intern** — *Phoenix Children’s Hospital (2024–2025)*

### 🌱 What I Do
I build transparent, reproducible analyses for healthcare and clinical data.  
My work blends statistical modeling, machine learning, and visual storytelling to uncover meaningful patterns in patient outcomes.

- 📊 Logistic, beta, and survival regression models in R & SAS  
- 🤖 Neural networks and SHAP explainability in Python  
- 🧠 Interactive dashboards and reproducible pipelines

### 🧬 Featured Project
#### [Predictors of Organ Transplant Outcomes →](https://github.com/krishamansukhani/transplant-outcomes-capstone)
Analyzed national HRSA transplant data (2019–2024) using **beta regression** and a **Keras neural network** to identify key predictors of one-year survival.  
💡 *Focus: equity gaps by donor type, insurance, and ethnicity*  
🎨 Includes Jupyter notebook, Tableau dashboard, and published paper.
